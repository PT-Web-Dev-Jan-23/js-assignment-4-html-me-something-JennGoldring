      <h2>Phoenix, Arizona</h2>
      <p>
         I grew up in Phoenix, Arizona. I was always curious about nature 
         and loved the outdoors. Growing up in the middle of the city there 
         wasn’t a lot of nature around. Even so, I craved it. I wanted to 
         explore the mountains in the distance. I wanted to have my feet 
         in the dirt and to feel the sun on my skin. As soon as I got my 
         drivers license I drove out to the desert for long hikes and the 
         solitude of nature. I’d take my dog Sedona and we’d be gone for hours. 
         This time outdoors led to me falling in love with birds. 
         I was curious about the quail, doves, and the cactus wrens. 
         I wasn’t passionate about the muted birds that were well camouflaged 
         in the desert, mostly I just loved the smell of dry arroyos and 
         petrichor, the way the smooth rocks in the shade would remain cool 
         even if it was 100 degrees, and the quite trails dotted with 
         occasional sounds of mourning doves. (can I insert a sound?)

      <h2>St. Louis, Missouri</h2>
      
      <p>
         Years later, I would move to St. Louis, Missouri and fully discover 
         my love for birds. I installed a bird feeder in our front yard outside 
         our kitchen window. The birds that came to the feeder were red and 
         bright yellow, iridescent black, and more. On my many hikes near 
         St. Louis I saw birds that were bright blue, yellow, and red. 
         These birds seemed flashy and colorful, unlike the birds in the 
         Sonora Desert. I bought a book about birds in the area and 
         started to learn the visiting birds and their behaviors. 
         Daily I’d have around 20 species of birds visiting my feeders 
         and yard. Grackles, crows, northern cardinals, chickadee, tufted 
         titmouse, starlings, Eurasian tree sparrows, house sparrows, 
         American gold finch, house finch, northern flickers, blue jays, 
         American robin, hairy, downy, and red belly woodpeckers and more. 
         Seeing this variety in just my front yard made want to learn more. 
         The more I learned the more birds showed up in my writing, the more 
         I wanted to photograph them, and the more I wanted to find as many 
         species as I could!

      <h2>Rockwoods Reservation (near St. Louis)</h2>
      <p>
It was the eastern bluebird that really captured my curious heart. 
One day, on a hike at Rockwoods Reservation, I saw a small flock of 
eastern bluebirds. They are small, shy birds and every time I got close 
enough to snap a photo they would fly further up the trail. I felt like 
these small birds were leading me through the forest. The flash of blue 
in a far tree became a little magical! It was exciting to try and capture 
them with my camera. </p>

<h2>Confluence of the Mighty Missouri and Mississippi</h2>
   <p>St. Louis happens to be a big area for birding. The Mississippi 
      and Missouri Rivers make it a flyway for birds. There are four main 
      flyways (paths of migration) in the United States and St. Louis is 
      right in the middle of the Mississippi Flyway. Because of this there 
      are a lot of places along the rivers to go bird and to see a lot of 
      interesting species. One of my favorite places to go is Riverlands 
      Migratory Bird Sanctuary. This area is on the confluence of the 
      Mississippi and Missouri Rivers and because of that it attracts many 
      migrating birds especially a wide variety of ducks, geese, pelicans 
      and many species of gulls. There is a lot of space for large flocks 
      of birds to rest. One cool autumn morning, I went out to Riverlands 
      just before sunrise and waited for the sun to come up over the 
      horizon. As I the sun rose the sounds of the birds became louder 
      and more frenetic. Even though I couldn’t see them, I could hear 
      the enchanting cacophony of their waking. </p>

<h2>Tower Grove Park (St. Louis, MO)</h>
    <p>One of my dear friends — that I love to hike with — has encyclopedic 
      knowledge about birds and nature. We started birding together about 
      13 years ago. One of our favorite places to go is the Gaddy Bird 
      Garden at Tower Grove Park. This area is called an Important Bird 
      Area (IBA), which means it is globally important for the conservation 
      of birds. It is also part of the Great Missouri Birding Trail. 
      This area is incredibly important because it is a rest-stop for 
      migrating birds. Some of those birds migrate from South America 
      to the far reaches of Canada and back again. It’s very exciting to 
      see these rare birds because they are just here for a very short 
      time (maybe a few weeks or a few months) as they make their way to 
      their breeding grounds. My friend and I head to the Gaddy Bird Garden 
      every migration season (late spring and early fall) to find as 
      many of these rare birds as we can.</p>

<h2>Wakodahatchee Wetlands & Green Cay Wetlands, Florida</h2>

<p></p>Several years ago I took a trip to Florida with my birding/hiking 
friend. We were only there for a long weekend, but we made a point to go 
birding at a couple of very cool birding sites. One of them is Wakodahatchee 
Wetlands and the other is Green Cay Wetlands. Both of these are amazing 
places to see a huge variety of birds. These wetlands are home to many 
rookeries (bird nursery) and they are both man made areas that have been 
turned into sanctuaries for birds. More than 170 species of birds have been 
identified here, including the purple gallinule, green herons, yellow-rumped 
warblers, bald eagles, a variety of hawks and flocks of shore birds, to 
name just a few. My favorite find at Wakodahatchee was an American Bittern. 
This bird hunts for fish and small crustaceans along the edges of marshy 
reeds. They blend in so well and move just like the reeds in the wind that 
they are very hard to find.

<h3>Seattle, Washington</h3>
<p>I have friend who lives near Seattle. I used to visit her a couple times a year. When I do, I love to go birding and see what I can find. Because it is a different region the birds are different than in St. Louis. In St. Louis we have blue jays and in Seattle they have Stellar’s jays. In St. Louis we have Northern Cardinals, their range doesn’t go as far east as Washington state. Both St. Louis and Seattle have Northern Flickers, but St. Louis has the yellow-shafted variety and Washington has the red-shafted variety. It’s very exciting to see the wide variety of birds and the differences in various regions. Every time I go to Washington I make time to go look for my feathered friends.

<h2>Columbia 2025</h2>
<p>
In winter of 2025 I am going to Columbia to go birding. This will be the trip of a lifetime because I will see many birds that I can’t see anywhere else. These are called endemic species. Columbia has 1,878 species of birds, and of those 83 are endemic! It’s very exciting to be able to see that many different birds in one place. The United States only has 800 species and that includes migration. Missouri only boasts 390 bird species. I am especially excited to try and see the multicolored tanager and the toucan barbet. Additionally, the Columbia trip will be a beautiful and culturally rich experience.

<h2>Last thoughts on birds</h2>

<p class="funParagraph"> Birds have become an important part of my life. I love nature and birding allows me a close connection to nature. Birds have made their way into my art, photography, poetry, and other writing. Birds help me feel connected to this planet and grounded. There are approximately 10,000 bird species in the world and I’ve only seen a small fragment. I can’t wait to see where my birding adventures take me over the next few decades.
